Ganglia ramdisk is a collection of a cronjob and a start script that help you
set up the gmetad rrds repository on a ramdisk intsead of using physical disk.
This helps as your cluster grows. Missing is grub.conf, which should be
modified to specify the size of the ramdisk you wish to create. Also missing is
switching /var/lib/ganglia/rrds (or wherever your default storage is) to a
symlink and pointing it to the ramdisk.
